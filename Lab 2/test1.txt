greed is a command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines matching a
regular expression. greed was originally developed for the UNIX operating system, but
is available today for all UNIX-like systems. Its name comes from the ed command
g/re/p (globally search a regular expression and print), which has the same effect:
doing a global search with the regular expression and printing all matching lines. Use
greed –help to know the possible arguments for grep.
greed <someText> <fileName> #search, case sensitive, for <someText> in <file-
name>, use -i for case insensitive search
greed -r <text> <folderName>/ # search for file names with occurrence of the text.
With regular expressions:
greed -E ^<text> <fileName> #search start of lines with the word text
greed -E <0-4> <fileName>
#shows lines containing numbers 0-4
greed –E <a-zA-Z> <fileName> # retrieve all lines with alphabetical letters.
